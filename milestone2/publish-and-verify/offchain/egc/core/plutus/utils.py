    output, which includes the coin field itself. In most cases this doesn't
    matter, but in edge cases: A small coin value serializes to fewer bytes than a
    large one.  After you bump coin, the output size could cross a threshold that
    changes the minimum. In practice this rarely causes issues because the min
    lovelace calculation has enough headroom, but if you want to be defensive, you
    can loop until it stabilizes.
